# flight-simulator

This project implemented a flight simulator using the Processing language. The inputs to the system come from the project https://github.com/jorgeamendezm/flight-simulator-data.

The overall project consisted in a system that detected the 3D position and orientation of an object (e.g., a hand) using a 3-axis capacitive sensor and a 3-axis accelerometer.
